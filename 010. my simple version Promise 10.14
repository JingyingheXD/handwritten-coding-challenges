Fulfill the simple version Promise

1. 3 status: fulfilled, rejected, pending
2. new Promise((resolve, reject) => {});
    resolve & reject are functions
3. how to use call() and bind() to bind this, and the differences between them
4. "this" in the myPromise function means the instance object of the current function
5. use handlers[] and errorHandlers[] to contain all then and catch functions
    However, it's a simple version. It doesn't catch errors in the handlers[]. Also, it doesn't include the functions execution sequences for functions in the handlers[] and errorHandlers[]
6. If there is a then() after catch(), it would still implement
7. race() vs all()
8. If resolve() is implemented, the promise status is fulfilled. If reject() is implemented, the promise status is rejected.
