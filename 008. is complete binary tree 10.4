Check if a tree is a complete binary tree

1. Complete binary tree: Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
2. steps:
  a. Check if the root is null. If it's null, return true
  b. Traverse the tree. If the current node is not null, push its left child and right child to the queue. Then pop out a node from the queue, and make it to the current node. Repeat the traversal until the current node is null.
  c. Check if there are any nodes with value in the queue. If there are, it's not a complete binary tree.
3. queue.filter(Boolean)
  Boolean(falsyValue) = false
  falsyValue: false, 0, '', null, undefined, NaN
