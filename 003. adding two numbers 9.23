Implement the functionality of adding two numbers without using the built-in arithmetic operations of the programming language.

1. the steps for adding (binary or decimals)ï¼š
  a. get the bit results. Using XOR^ in binary
  b. get the carry character. Using AND& in binary
  c. recursively call the function itself until one property is zero, like repeating (a+b)
2. AND&, OR|, NOT~, XOR^, left shift<<, right shift>>
