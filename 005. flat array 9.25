Creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.

Steps:
1. get the first element in the current array
2. if it's an array, recursively call the function;
   if it isn't an array, append it to the original array
3. recursively put the left elements to the function and append them to the original array

Notes:
1. instanceof
2. how to flatten an array in specific depth?
  a. check if n is 0
  b. when it relates to go deeper of the array, the parameter should be n-1
  c. when put the left elements to the function, the parameter should be n
