How would you implement the addition of two huge numbers that exceed the range of the Number type?
Note that since these two numbers exceed the range of the Number type, they cannot be stored as numbers. Instead, we choose to store them as strings.

1. padding the short number with 0
2. sum each number with a carried property, and don't forget to check the carried property finally

Note:
1. string --> number: Number("321"), OR +"234"
   number --> string: 321.toString()
2. use a pointer to indicate the bit in these two strings, and pad "0" when there is no such a bit
3. a.unshift()
4. a.join['']
